# Evaluation-Test-PODIO
This contains my code for the evaluation test for GSOC 2019 Implementing HDF5 IO layer for PODIO

To run my code do the following:

# . script.sh   (or bash script.sh)


Then to run my C++ code for evaluation test do the following:


#   make compileWrite

#   make compileRead


It will run the code(Write.cpp and Read.cpp) and produce an output with SimpleStruct Array and also an output.h5 file from which it reads and writes.

Redundancies have been removed
