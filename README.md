# Evaluation-Test-PODIO
This contains my code for the evaluation test for GSOC 2019 Implementing HDF5 IO layer for PODIO

To run my code do the following:

Wherever PODIO code is downloaded from github run the script.sh file in that directory by doing :-

# . script.sh   (or bash script.sh)


Then to run my C++ code for evaluation test do the following:

#  make

#  make test
  
It will run the code(Answer.cpp) and produce an output with SimpleStruct Array and also an output.h5 file from which it reads and writes
